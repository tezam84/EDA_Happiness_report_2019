# ðŸ˜ƒ EDA_numerical_Happiness_report_2019
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of numerical observations only on more than 100 countries (2019).

The goal is to understand the correlation between a country labelled "Happy" and the factors linked to it.

Here's are some factors: GPD per capita, social support, generosity, rank... 

This project is created with the following Python packages: Numpy, Pandas, Matplolib, Seaborn.

I have used a heatmap to have a clear visualization and the corr() method. 

My goal was to explore different ways to implement EDA (use of different functions), so feel free to pick up the more relevant method in your project.
