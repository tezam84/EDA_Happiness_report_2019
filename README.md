# ðŸ˜ƒ EDA_Happiness_report_2019
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of numerical and categorical observations on more than 100 countries in 2019.

The goal is to understand the correlation between a country labelled "Happy" and the factors linked to it.

Here's are some factors: GPD per capita, social support, generosity, rank... 

This project is created with the following Python packages: Numpy, Pandas, Matplolib, Seaborn.

I have used a heatmap to have a clear visualization and the corr() method.
